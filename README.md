# Frontend Mentor - In-browser markdown editor solution

This is a solution to the [In-browser markdown editor challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/inbrowser-markdown-editor-r16TrrQX9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
Additionally, I decided to make this the one of my capstone projects for my FrontEnd Coding Bootcamp With Promineo Tech.
Here are the requirements of that:

- Create a full CRUD application of your choice.

- When using an existing API, use AJAX to interact with it.

- Note: You do not have to use an API. If you do not use an API, store the entities you will create, read, update, and delete in an array.

-- Use a form to add new entities
-- Build a way for users to update or delete entities
-- Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
